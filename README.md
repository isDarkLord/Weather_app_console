# Weather_app_console
just a simple weather app console using a free api from openweather api.

# How to use
First copy the code and compile it replacing the token with ur own.
The token is generated per account so u can create a account with ur own gmail account or
be smart and get a temp email then use it. I think the free account also have limits but its not tat important. After u replace the token u can compile using this command
```
g++ -std=c++11 weather.cpp -o weather_app -lcurl
```
Then u can run by using this command
```
./test # Linux(based) also i think using powershell u can acheive the same result
```
# Why create this?
I forgot how to use c++ so learning creating random projects.
